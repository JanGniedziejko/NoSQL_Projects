# NoSQL_Projects
This repository consist of 4 projects (Hive, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j) and they were parts of courses at Gdansk University of Technology: Nonrelational Databases, and Advanced Nonrelational Databases. The purpose was to familiarize yourself with the new tools and gain fundamental knowledge from Nonrelational databases such as: Keyvalue, Document and Graph databases

## [Neo4j](https://github.com/JanGniedziejko/NoSQL_Projects/tree/main/Neo4j%20-%20Graph%20Databases)
This project involves the development of a graph database for an e-ticket purchasing platform. 
The goal is to model the business process using Cypher queries (CRUD operations) and competency questions.
- defining business domain assumptions
- create Cypher statements for database constructio
- present competency questions both in natural and Cypher DML language

## Redis
This project focuses on creating a Redis database for a warehouse management system. It demonstrates the use of Redis features like data types,PUB/SUB, and transactions to implement a complex usage scenario.

## MongoDB
The project is about book reading application. There are three collections implemented (Catalogue, Users, Reviews) + 4 competency questions that are presented in both natural language and queries. This project includes sharding, zones and replication.

## Hive
The goal is to implement a simplified data warehouse for a high school. The project includes defining a schema with at least three data types, internal and external tables, partitioning, complex types, and bucketing. Students must also define competency questions, explain design decisions, and write HQL queries that demonstrate the system's functionality.
