# NoSQL_Projects
This repository consists of four projects (Hive, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j) from courses at Gdansk University of Technology: Nonrelational Databases and Advanced Nonrelational Databases. The purpose was to familiarize students with different NoSQL tools and gain foundational knowledge of NoSQL database types, including Key-Value, Document, and Graph databases.    


## [Neo4j](https://github.com/JanGniedziejko/NoSQL_Projects/tree/main/Neo4j%20-%20Graph%20Databases) - E-ticket Purchasing Platform

This project involves developing a graph database for an e-ticket purchasing platform. The goal is to model the business process using Cypher queries (CRUD operations) and competency questions.

Define business domain assumptions
Create Cypher statements for database construction
Present competency questions in both natural language and Cypher DML language

## [Redis](https://github.com/JanGniedziejko/NoSQL_Projects/tree/main/Redis%20-%20KeyValue%20Databases) - Warehouse Management System

This project focuses on building a Redis database for a warehouse management system. It demonstrates the use of Redis features such as data types, PUB/SUB, and transactions to implement a complex usage scenario.

## [MongoDB](https://github.com/JanGniedziejko/NoSQL_Projects/tree/main/MongoDB%20-%20Document%20Databases) - E-book Application

The project involves an e-book application with three collections: Catalogue, Users, and Reviews. Four competency questions are presented in both natural language and queries. The project includes sharding, zones, and replication for optimal data management.

## [Hive](https://github.com/JanGniedziejko/NoSQL_Projects/tree/main/Hive) - High School Data Warehouse

The objective of this project is to implement a data warehouse for a high school with sample data. The project includes defining a schema with at least three data types, internal and external tables, partitioning, complex types, and bucketing. It also features competency questions, explanations of design decisions, and HQL queries demonstrating the system's functionality.
