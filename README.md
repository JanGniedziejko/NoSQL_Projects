# NoSQL_Projects
collection of NoSQL projects using: Hive, Redis, MongoDB, and Neo4j. Projects were parts of courses at Gdansk University of Technology: Nonrelational Databases, and Advanced Nonrelational Databases

## Neo4j
This project involves the development of a graph database for an e-ticket purchasing platform. 
The goal is to model the business process using Cypher queries (CRUD operations) and competency questions.
- defining business domain assumptions
- create Cypher statements for database constructio
- present competency questions both in natural and Cypher DML language

## Redis
This project focuses on creating a Redis database for a warehouse management system. It demonstrates the use of Redis features like data types, Pub/Sub, and transactions to implement a complex usage scenario. Students must propose operations, implement them with Redis commands, and showcase how these features complement each other to solve real-world problems. The solution is presented with a live demo of Redis operations.

## MongoDB
The task involves designing a MongoDB database for a book reading application. Students need to implement at least three collections, provide four data retrieval queries (including one aggregation pipeline), and shard one collection with multiple replicas. The project requires the addition of 20 documents and the setup of a sharded database. The solution involves practical implementation of MongoDB features to manage data efficiently.

## Hive
In this project, students implement a data warehouse for a high school subject. The project includes defining a schema with at least three data types, internal and external tables, partitioning, complex types, and bucketing. Students must also define competency questions, explain design decisions, and write HQL queries that demonstrate the system's functionality. The solution is presented as a data warehouse setup, including data loading scripts and queries.
